# Irrigate donation: [=> visit](https://irrigateapp.xyz/)  

Irrigate is a platform that aims to gather NGOs and associatons with donors from around the world.   
NGOs and associations can apply to appear in the main page after going through a validation process.   
Donors can register and see all the NGOs and associations available for donations.  
Because its purpose is to provide global visibility, the donations are meant to be sent via crypto currencies to reduce international transfer costs and intermediaries issues.   
Irrigate retains 1% of the donations to support the costs of activities.  
The project was first published during a hackathon, and is now a prototype for a real case application.
